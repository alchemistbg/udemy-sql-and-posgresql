Practice Deleting Records

We are once again working with the phones table.

You are going to write two separate queries

The first query should delete all phones that were created by Samsung

The second query should select all rows and columns of the phones table

+-------------+--------------+-------+------------+
| name        | manufacturer | price | units_sold |
+-------------+--------------+-------+------------+
| N1280       | Nokia        | 199   | 1925       |
+-------------+--------------+-------+------------+
| Iphone 4    | Apple        | 399   | 9436       |
+-------------+--------------+-------+------------+
| Galaxy S    | Samsung      | 299   | 2359       |
+-------------+--------------+-------+------------+
| S5620 Monte | Samsung      | 250   | 2385       |

| N8          | Nokia        | 150   | 7543       |
