Three Way Exercise

Hmmm...I wonder if any authors are writing their own reviews for books! You are working with a database of books, authors, and reviews

Write a query that will return the title of each book, along with the name of the author, and the rating of a review.  Only show rows where the author of the book is also the author of the review.

Table of authors

    +----+-----------------+
    | id | name            |
    +----+-----------------+
    | 1  | Stephen King    |
    +----+-----------------+
    | 2  | Agatha Christie |
    +----+-----------------+
    | 3  | JK Rowling      |
    +----+-----------------+

Table of books

    +----+---------------------+-----------+
    | id | title               | author_id |
    +----+---------------------+-----------+
    | 1  | The Dark Tower      | 1         |
    +----+---------------------+-----------+
    | 2  | Affair At Styles    | 2         |
    +----+---------------------+-----------+
    | 3  | Chamber of Secrets  | 3         |
    +----+---------------------+-----------+

Table of reviews

    +----+--------+-------------+---------+
    | id | rating | reviewer_id | book_id |
    +----+--------+-------------+---------+
    | 1  | 3      | 1           | 2       |
    +----+--------+-------------+---------+
    | 2  | 4      | 2           | 1       |
    +----+--------+-------------+---------+
    | 3  | 5      | 3           | 3       |
    +----+--------+-------------+---------+
